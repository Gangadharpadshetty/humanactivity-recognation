# Human Activity Recognition

## Overview

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is the task of classifying human activities based on sensor data. This project aims to develop a system that can accurately recognize various human activities using machine learning techniques.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Feature extraction
- Model training and evaluation
- Real-time activity recognition

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
       ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/gangadhaarpadhshetty/human-activity-recognition.git
       ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
       ```bash
       cd human-activity-recognition
       ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
       ```bash
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data` directory.
2. Run the preprocessing script:
       ```bash
       python preprocess.py
       ```
3. Train the model:
       ```bash
       python train.py
       ```
4. Evaluate the model:
       ```bash
       python evaluate.py
       ```
5. Run real-time activity recognition:
       ```bash
       python recognize.py
       ```
